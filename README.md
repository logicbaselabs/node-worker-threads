# 🚀 Node.js Worker Threads Tutorial - Multithreading in Practice — logicBase labs

Welcome to the official source code repository for the **Node.js Worker Threads Tutorial - Multithreading in Practice** on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@logicBaseLabs). This video tutorial is designed to help you boost backend performance with Node.js worker_threads. Offload CPU-heavy work from the main thread, build an Express demo, use Promise.all to merge results, and scale across CPU cores—no blocking, faster responses. A clear, practical guide for backend JS devs.
